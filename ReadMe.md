### Justine Evans Section 51

First, I would like to apologize for my homework being late. My uncle Scott passed away and I had a rough time adjusting. He had Hunnington's Disease. To make things even better, my macbook was *destroyed by my niece* >.<. So now, I am resorting to a PC from Amazon which is a new feeling to me. Until I get a new Macbook.

(Feeling better now, and hoping to kick some Web Development-butt.)

For this assignment, I spent **a lot** of time trying to figure out how to use the command prompt on a windows computer. In the past, I had much success with my Mac, and learning the operating systems on a PC was definitely challenging. But really, I am enjoying this class! :)

I successfly learned how to create a folder through command prompt, and how to name said folder. I learned how to use Git to initialize and commit the files inside of my folder through the command prompt (git init) and (git commit)

I was able to learn how to open a text document (through command prompt) into a text editor (Atom...here we are!) ^-^

I think the most *difficult* part of the assignment for me was learning how to use GIT. I did feel like a badass when I
1. finally
2. learned
3. how
4. to
5. use
6. [command prompt!] (http://www.memecenter.com/search/command%20prompt)

When I was first using command prompt, I made several errors. I didn't realize that I had made three folders that were all 341-work folders. So when I was using Git, I kept having error messages when trying to commit files and initialize. Since I was late to turn in this homeowrk, I was able to browse some of the questions that my classmates had posted on the github site. But what helped me overall is my boyfriend who is finishing his degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science. He saw my errors right away and literally **face-palmed** *>.>* There is definitley a difference in our brains. For I am an artist, and he does not understand how I don't understand **CODING** (Well gee, maybe I'm a Media Arts major and not a computer science minor?! heheheh) ! [I added a funny image here] (https://www.google.com/search?q=left+brain+right+brain+meme&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZptrm-JzSAhUXzGMKHf0MBxEQ_AUICCgB&biw=1366&bih=608#imgrc=eg_UkySBngsVFM:)

It's hard to summarize the steps that I took to complete this assignment. I followed the instructions on the MART 341 Website, I browsed the internet and github for resources, and I recruited my boyfriend for help.

Since I was late with my homework, I was unable to help my classmates with their homework. But I'm hoping in the future that things will calm down in my personal life, and I can strive to help my classmates versus focusing on getting through the week, and passing the semester.

Thanks for **EVERY** thing ![images of my editor](C:\Users\Kyle\Documents\341-work\week-02-assignment)
