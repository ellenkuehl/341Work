        <p>Here is Hubby having some pork for breakfast! You can tell that he is getting used to using his chopsticks. ;) since he is 13 years old, my sister
          makes sure that he gets plenty of fresh, organic meat! He loves salmon, squid, beef, pork. The only thing he does not like is cow tongue!
