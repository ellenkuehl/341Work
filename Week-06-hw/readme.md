Well, unfortunately I am late with assignments and this sucks! Upon my departure to Japan, I had boughten a new computer and created a pull-request the night before I left. This pull request had worked perfectly and I thought I would have no problems while abroad. Unfortunately, while I was in Japan, I had major issues with my computer utilizing my files correctly. So, I'm really sorry for the late assignments and for not emailing you sooner!

Thankfully, I have all of easter weekend to catch-up and do my best to learn!

I have to say that Week 6's homework was probably the most challenging of the homeworks yet. I really enjoy the creative side of the web design class and it's very fulfilling to see the end results, but I'm not sure my brain is always set up to process coding correctly.

 I think what was confusing about this particular assignment was learning how to link everything together correctly. We have had some practice with hyperlinks, but this was the first one that required multiple pages to be linked! I really enjoyed experimenting with this but ultimately chose a simple method to link back to the same 'home' page.

The second most difficult part about this homework was trying to embed and host a video correctly. It took me several hours of watching tutorials and learning different methods of code to do this properly, but I'm happy to say that I was successful with doing this! I focused this particular assignment on my childhood dog, Hubby, who my family has had since I was 9. My sister moved to Japan three years ago and took Hubby with her! I thought it would be a fun, cute way to include some portion of my trip into my homework!

Another accomplishment for me was learning how to use my IMG's properly! UGH! It drove me nuts in the previous assignments when I couldn't figure out what was wrong. The previous email that you sent me had really helped me clarify what I was doing wrong- so thank you!

I wish I had used the < div> element better! I think it was kind of confusing to think of a way to use this element to organize portions of my web pages. I hope I utilized these correctly, as I used them the only way I could comprehend.

Besides that, I would say I feel like I had success with this homework! I don't tend to have too much trouble with this class, and when I do, I find the internet is a great resource, as well as emailing my instructor!
