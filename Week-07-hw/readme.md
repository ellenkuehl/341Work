## Web Development

### Section 51

After enlisting my friend who works at CodeAcademy for help, I finally have completed this assignment. I'm really glad I did the reading beforehand as I feel this really helped me understand how HTML and CSS combine to create one website.

This was probably the most difficult assignment that I've had in this class, yet! Although I say that whenever I learn something new that I'm not fully grasping haha. It has been a difficult semester between family death, working full-time in a hospital, and figuring out how to manage 15 credits on top of it.

This class has been the most difficult for me as I wouldn't consider myself an abstract thinker, and I don't know if I have the proper thinking style to ever be a coder. But, I'm really happy to say that I feel as though I've learned alot throughout my errors. It used to be that linking a picture was enough to make me upset, and now I can easily link a picture but spend 4 hours trying to figure out how to use the **Hover element**. To me, that is success. I have continued to push myself this semester and have found that with the support of my classmates, instructor, and friends who work in coding...I can accomplish anything!



I chose to use 'The Boy Who Wanted More Cheese' as the idea behind my design. I enjoy fun, bright pastel colors and decided that using a more child-like design would be the best way to approach this idea. I chose a fun-font that I thought seemed youthful in nature.

I used purple, yellow, and white as my main color design, and used a picture of a boy sitting on his cheese for humor. I felt that this web-page could actually be one that you could find on pinterest! I watch my best friend's daughter from time to time, and this website has reminded me of many that I have seen other nursery-rhymes and child stories on... I would say, success!

 I decided to use a deep purple for the head of the website as I feel this made the title stand out.
I successfully used the **hover** elemnt over the description of the website, and was able to use the **first letter** for the psuedo-class requirement to highlight the intro of my paragraph, and the ending.

All in all, I am happy with the end result of this project.
