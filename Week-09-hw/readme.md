## Web Development

### Ellen Kuehl, Section 51

As I progress in Web Development, I find that my favorite part of this course is learning how to design each page, and tweaking it to make it my own. When I found out that Media Arts required Web Development/Design courses, I thought two things:

-Oh Lanta, I hope I'm smart enough!

and

-What is the use?

I didn't understand how Media Arts and Web Dev would interact. I always assumed that if I ever needed a webpage to be made, then I could reach out and pay for it to be done.


Reflecting on my initial responses, I find it funny that I once didn't understand the importance of this class in my degree. I don't think that I have a natural talent for this course, but I do enjoy seeing the final product of each web page that I have made, and seeing how far I have progressed.

I remember Week Two's assignment where we learned about text editors and how to create an HTML document. I downloaded both Sourcetree and ATOM thinking I needed both in order to create my web page. Those were the days... And now, here I am, learning how to use CSS!! Crazy!

(I don't need to pay for a web page, I can make my own! :) )

For this web page, I decided to use a maroon and mustard-yellow combination that complimented the page's gif. I wanted the page to have a fun, light feel, and found that the Lucia Sans Unicode text style provided that idea, as well as the brightness of the yellow. I think contrasting with the mustard-yellow, the maroon provided a more elegant feel.

The most difficult part of this assignment for me learning how to make a drop-down menu. I get confused when trying to code my li and ul's (trying to count them properly so I can CSS them properly) but after several youtube tutorials, I was successful!

Thank you for your continued support!
