This week of MART 341 Has been my best yet! I feel like I finally got **somewhat** caught up my homework AND I absolutely *loved* this weeks homework.

I feel like I learned so much with this assignment. I learned how to create an index.html page, use HTML code to create the body and style of my web page, and successfully launched said page through GITHUB!! Wahoo!

I think the most challenging part for me was just getting my Github App to link correctly to my Githube page. I couldn't figure out how to commit changes and the instructions didn't necessarily work for me. But thankfully, I was able to find a **super-awesome** coding website that helped me understand how to do so. Unfortunately, I had so much trial and error today, I'm afrait GITHUB might fire me from the class.

I think what I have really enjoyed is adding the final touches to my website, and having the chance to express some creativity through the HTML! I love cute things, so I've been adding some Japanese Emoticons to my page, and also playing with the italics, bold, and heading codes!

Anyways, I recognize that I need to be more active in supporting my peers and seeking help through them, so I will start working on that. But really, I have enjoyed this class so far and can't wait to continue learning! What I'm looking forward to is learning some CSS so I can have a powder-pink background for my webiste.
