<h1>Moshi Moshi!ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ (Hello!) </h1>
<p> 始めまして! ^-^ 私は餅が大好き! </p>
<p> Nice to meet you, I <i>love</i> mochi.( ˘▽˘)っ </p>
<p> This is my <em>first</em> <b>EVER</b> web page! I'm really excited to continue learning. </p>

<h2> Soulmate </h2>
<h3>By me! (Writing is fun)</h3>
<p>She said, He is exactly the poem I wanted to write!<br>
  He's the kind of man that, you don't care if he's smarter than you, because you <i>know</i> he is <br>
  And the funny thing is, is that I never thought he would be a good fit for me<br>
  I love unmade beds, he loves folded linens<br>
  I love the color black, and he kisses color to the sky </p>

<p> She said, sometimes I think people you expect the least, are the ones you need the most<br>
  Sometimes I think a soulmate is someone that can make you the most "you" that you can be</p>
