  <h2>How To Make The Offering <em>No</em> Forest Spirit Can Resist!</h2>
<p>Forest Spirits, otherwise known as Totoros, are responsible for maintaining the quality of the Earth's land. Totoros date back to the Miyazaki
  era, but are not properly documented until the rise of Studio Ghibli. Although their proper name is <dfn>Totoru</dfn>, or "Trolls," they prefer to be
  referred as Totoro, or Forest Spirit. <strong>Rarely</strong>, when you get close with a Totoro, they may allow you to call them <abbr title="Totoro">Tutu's.</abbr> </P>
   <p>It is proper to express gratitude to Totoros at least yearly. Although it is never mentioned in the movie <cite> Totoro</cite>, their favorite
     gift is Forest Spirit Kuchikamizake</p>.
     <p>This recipe may seem easy, remember to put all your effort and love in.
  As said in <cite>Totoro</cite>,<q>Everybody try laughing! Then whatever scares you will go away!</q> It is more important that your offering is made
with love and laughter, rather than with frustration and grief!</p>
<h2>So............ฅ( ̳͒•ಲ• ̳͒)♪...........Let's Begin!</h2>
<hr />


<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1lb of Organic Rice</li>
  <li>4 cups of Rose Water</li>
  <li>2oz of Himalayan Pink Salt</li>
  <li>One bunch of Baby's-Breath<ol>
<li>*One bunch of Lavender</li>
<li>*One Eucalyptus leaf</li></ol>

<p><b>Directions:</b> On a Spring evening, gather all ingredients for your Kuchikamizake.
  Boil the salt, water, and Baby's Breath together unttil flowers are wilted and water is frothy. Add the rice. After the rice is done cooking, remove from heat. When rice is cool, carefully chew small mouth-fulls and place into airtight containers, or one big container.
  Allow combination to ferment for 30 days before offering to Totoros.
</p><p>
  <strong>!It is important that your container is airtight for the Kuchikamizake fermenting
    process!</strong></p>


    <p><em>*=Substitute. It is important to note that Baby's-Breath may be substituted with 1 or 2. This will not alter the quality of your Kuchikamizake. You can also prepare the recipe with all three!</em>
<hr />
    <p> And you are done! You now have one of the finest Forest Spirit Offerings available. That was so <del>easy</del> <ins>FUN</ins>, right!?</p>
