### Ellen Kuehl, Section 51, Week 4!

(•ө•)♡
Here we are with **Week 4!**
These past two weeks have been my *favorite*, mostly because I have the chance to individualize my page and be creative while doing so! Learning to use the programs was a little confusing/frustrating at first. Now that I'm starting to understand how PC's work, and how to properly manage my repositories through my Github Desktop, I feel like I'm starting to relax more and do better at the assignments!

This week I decided to make my own fake recipe page based on Hayao Miyazaki's classic film, <cite>Totoro</cite>. I love Hayao Miyazaki's animation, and thought it would be a fun and creative exercise to base my assignment around him. I enjoyed getting to use the blockquote tag when quoting Miyazaki, and using the nesting lists to write out my recipe! I was intimidated by the nesting instructions at first, but after messing around on Atom for a while, I was able to make sense of it.

(As a side note, I've enjoyed learning the sub and sups tags, like Co<sub>2</sub> and 2<sup>2</sup>=4! Sadly, I didn't get to use them in my assignment, but I like how cute the mini numbers are. Or of course, I could use them for a date, like The 4<sup>th</sup> of July!)

What I struggled with this week was learning how to connect my personal webpages with eachother. I think conceptually, I didn't understand how I could connect my pages, but I found the resolution to my issue within the Issues section on Github! I have such smart classmates!

For my contribution, I commented on an Issue to help a classmate learn how to take a screenshot on her Toshiba. I have a Toshiba myself, and tried to give detailed instructions. Other classmates had commented, but no one had commented the same instructions. Most were recommending to use the snippet tool for screenshots, which can work, but I gave her directions on how to take a screenshot using PRNTSCRN and FN. I also posted a link to the PDF version of the HTML and CSS book that we are reading, just in case anyone didn't have it!
