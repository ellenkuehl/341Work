### Ellen Kuehl, Section 51, Week 4!

(•ө•)♡
Here we are with **Week 4!**
These past two weeks have been my *favorite*, mostly because I have the chance to individualize my page and be creative while doing so! Learning to use the programs was a little confusing/frustrating at first. Now that I'm starting to understand how PC's work, and how to properly manage my repositories through my Github Desktop, I feel like I'm starting to relax more and do better at the assignments!

This week I decided to make my own fake recipe page based on Hayao Miyazaki's classic film, <cite>Totoro</cite>. I love Hayao Miyazaki's animation, and thought it would be a fun and creative exercise to base my assignment around him. I enjoyed getting to use the blockquote tag when quoting Miyazaki, and using the nesting lists to write out my recipe! I was intimidated by the nesting instructions at first, but after messing around on Atom for a while, I was able to make sense of it.

(As a side note, I've enjoyed learning the sub and sups tags, like Co<sub>2</sub> and 2<sup>2</sup>=4! Sadly, I didn't get to use them in my assignment, but I like how cute the mini numbers are. Or of course, I could use them for a date, like The 4<sup>th</sup> of July!)

What I struggled with this week was learning how to connect my personal webpages with eachother. I think conceptually, I didn't understand how I could connect my pages, but I found the resolution to my issue within the Issues section on Github! I have such smart classmates!

For my contribution, I commented on an Issue to help a classmate learn how to take a screenshot on her Toshiba. I have a Toshiba myself, and tried to give detailed instructions. Other classmates had commented, but no one had commented the same instructions. Most were recommending to use the snippet tool for screenshots, which can work, but I gave her directions on how to take a screenshot using PRNTSCRN and FN. I also posted a link to the PDF version of the HTML and CSS book that we are reading, just in case anyone didn't have it!

The Wayback Machine was very interesting! I had a lot of fun searching through the websites of my favorite childhood movies and video games. I grew up playing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and watching movies like The Land Before Time. I was initially hoping that I would be able to use either Crash Bandicoot or Spyro as my pre-2000's website, but unfortunately, their websites weren't regularly updated until around 2002.

For my pre-2000 webiste, I decided to look into inGen, AKA Jurassic Park's lost world website: [http://www.lost-world.com/ingen/index.html] !
This website has been present since 1997. The initial website had similar design as the modern day website, but the first snapshot shows the website that have links stating 'This website is under construction!' Throughout the timeline, you see several changes in text and hyperlinks. It's kind of fascinating to see the construction of a website.
The cool part about this website is that it still maintains the same design as it did back in 1997, and although the site is ancient, it still works! The changes were minimal for this site throughout time.

For my post-2000's website, I decided to focus in on [http://www.furinkan.com/]! Rumiko Takahashi is the famous Japanese artist of Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and other world-renowed stories. Rumiko's website started in 2000. Now, it wasn't until 2003 that she really started updating her webiste. We don't see the first snapshot of her website until the 22nd of July in 2001. At this snapshot, Rumiko is promoting her series Ranma 1/2. You can look through a list of the series' characters, sign a guest book, browse items, and even view cultural notes on the series! This was interesting for me to see because I see no mention of her famous story Inuyasha! That must mean that this series wasn't created yet! (0.0)
Moving into 2004, we see that Rumiko has updated her art on her website. We now have access to Inuyasha, although she is still celebrating Ranma 1/2, but now has an link for "Rumic World," which must be some sort of fan-base for Rumiko fans! She has deepened the color of her art(from turqouise blue to navy), as well as the style.
Throughout 2004-2005, Rumiko updated her website more than any other period in her web history this far! While clicking on various dates throughout the year, she is constantly changing her webpage background, links, and link availability.
Around May 30th of 2005, Rumiko updated her website which is almost 100% similar to the way it is now. The constant updating of her website seems to halt in 2008, and never seems to update as much as it did in 2004-2005. Throughout the years after 2008, we see her webpage having the same original background, but they are constantly updating different stories available to the consumer, and giving sneak-peeks at upcoming art.
It was enjoyable to see the evolution of my favorite artist. Also very inspiring!
