It seems as I progress every week, I enjoy my homework more and more! This week, I decided to focus on creating a "Doggie Website" where the website visitor could enter their information and thoughts for 'help' with their dog. I successfully learned how to create different entry-style formats! Heck, I could start creating my own surveys! Wahoo! There are still several concepts in this section that I don't fully grasp, but ultimately feel like I did okay!


The only thing that did trouble me initially was having an **error** message pop-up when trying to open Atom. As you can imagine, this was increasingly frustrating as I got closer to the due date, and was unable to access my text editor. Thankfully, a quick google search showed me that I could uninstall and reinstall the Atom program, which I did.

The most frustrating thing for me has been imbedding images. I have had such a problem with this. I have spent four hours (not exaggerating) trying to move my files, use differnt file paths, etc, to try and get my images to work and I have had no success. I have tried accessing the issues board but the one person who had image problems had a different file type issue than what I have. I did see one other student whose file formats look exactly like mine, and she too is having issues. Unfortunately, she has had no response for answers. I have tried looking online for differnt coding styles and to see what other coders suggest, but they all are usually the same file format that we are. I have gone through and looked for any capital letter errors, punctuation errors, etc. Hopefully I can figure out my problem soon. Its frustrating to feel like you are great at 75% of something, but still lack the other 25%.

I'm really excited to start using images to decorate my pages....when I do learn! I think this will help me expand my creativity, and will also allow me to enjoy developing web pages more.
