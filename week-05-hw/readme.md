It seems as I progress every week, I enjoy my homework more and more! This week, I decided to focus on creating a "Doggie Website" where the website visitor could enter their information and thoughts for 'help' with their dog. I successfully learned how to create different entry-style formats! Heck, I could start creating my own surveys! Wahoo! There are still several concepts in this section that I don't fully grasp, but ultimately feel like I did okay!


Oddly enough, I had no problems or issues with this assignment, and this may be the first time in my Web Development history that this has happened. The only thing that did trouble me initially was having an **error** message pop-up when trying to open Atom. As you can imagine, this was increasingly frustrating as I got closer to the due date, and was unable to access my text editor. Thankfully, a quick google search showed me that I could uninstall and reinstall the Atom program, which I did.

I'm really excited to start using images to decorate my pages. I think this will help me expand my creativity, and will also allow me to enjoy developing web pages more.
