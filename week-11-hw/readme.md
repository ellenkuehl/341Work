I'm sorry I'm late!:( On the bright side, I've been working all day {not all...6 hours though..:) } on my web dev homework/final! Wahoo! I'm really excited with how my final is turning out!

For this assignment, I learned how to make a parallax site. I definitely had a few troubles with how to correctly style my CSS and had to refer to several classmates for help. Ultimately, I think I did a good job!

I based my site off of **badass** video games from the 90's (please excuse the language!) For my 3rd birthday, I got a PS1 and the games Crash Bandicoot and Spyro. This was my introduction to video games and gave me a lifelong connection to Media Arts. So, I thought I would give a little 'hurrah' to them by creating this site!

I threw in Harvest Moon on the side because... I love Harvest Moon!

I wish the images would be more centered, but overall I think it turned out okay.
